ðŸŽ‰ Just built my own Python voice assistant â€“ Jarvis!

It can:

Recognize voice commands

Search Wikipedia

Open websites like YouTube, Google, ChatGPT

Play music and tell time

Launch apps like VS Code

Built using: Python, pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, and more.

Proud of what Iâ€™ve learned in NLP, automation, and Python integration.
Excited for whatâ€™s next!
